[o] Please come in.

Welcome to my apartment. I trust you'll find my voice is more palatable against this decor. I continue to be an excellent host.

I'm expecting two more guests later. First one, and then another. 

Make yourself comfortable in the meantime. But don't touch the candy on the table. That is reserved for one of my guests.

[o] Let's have a look at this disc.
16/05/11
She really did a number on it, didn't she? It's virtually unplayable like this.

What a shame. There are many moments trapped on this disc which you would have no doubt found to be quite exhilarating.

[o] But yes, I can fix it.
16/05/11
HOMESTUCK 1 ... 2
It will take time, though. I estimate, by which I mean I am certain by way of omniscience, that when I am done we will have reached just shy of the green circle on the card above. I'm sure you have already presumed this mark represents the beginning of Act 6. The disc should be ready to run in time to witness the Critical Event, a confluence of thickly interwoven, aconcurrent circumstances which have been meticulously arranged by myself, influenced to a much lesser extent by you, and by an even more negligible degree, our heroes. The scratch will be healed in time to watch these heroes put into motion, yes, The Scratch itself.

If you don't mind waiting here while I complete my repairs, I will tell the rest of the story. I will show you as well, as I recover data from the disc. But the visuals I supply will be nothing more than abbreviated snapshots, and my telling will be abridged. 

Immortality notwithstanding, I'm not going to live forever, you know.

[o] Tick.
16/05/11
And since for once in my life, time is at a premium, let's get on with it. Where were we?

[o] Tock.
16/05/11
Never mind, I figured it out instantly because of my unfathomable intellect, limitless knowledge, and mind boggling charisma. Granted, my charisma had less to do with it than the other qualities. But it didn't hurt, did it?

Here, I'll show you.

[o] Tick.

The Seer of Mind had challenged the Thief of Light to a simple game of chance. 

If the result was the undamaged side, the Thief would agree to stay. If not, she would "go."

[o] Tock.
16/05/11
The result of the flip was left inconclusive, at which point you decided to pay me a visit. 

But the inconclusive should not be confused with the uncertain. The actual result was trivial; it was a constant across all timelines.

[o] Both the Seer and the Thief knew this.
16/05/11
The Thief used her abilities to steal the fortune of her opponent, and forced the flip to yield what she regarded as the most favorable outcome. The Seer anticipated this move, correctly.

This is why I don't care much for gambling. While a sucker is born with each tick of the clock, a cheater is born with each tock betwixt.

Also, because it is boring, and I am already a very wealthy man.

[o] Tick.
18/05/11
The Seer relayed her terms through the generally understood argot of an assassin. The result "go," while at face value would suggest the Thief was allowed to leave, was actually the Seer's code word for the threat of death. This was obvious to everyone, including the Thief.

[o] Tock.
18/05/11
While the Thief turned to fly away, making a show of claiming her prize, the Seer would stab her in the back the moment her guard was dropped. This was her plan. Not a particularly clever tactic in its own right, but its ingenuity didn't dwell in the novelty of the ruse, nor even the neutralized probabilities in the game of chance. Psychology was in play.

[o] Tick.
18/05/11
Naturally, the Thief knew this was her intent all along. She knew the Seer would have understood the outcome to be rigged, and that she likely intended to kill her as a consequence of the fixed result. This was to be seen as an implicit dare to the Thief to allow the flip to fall fairly, something which the Seer knew the Thief's ego wouldn't allow.

And the Seer knew the Thief knew all this as well. 

Just another pair of cheaters attempting to play with their cards face up. Amateurs.

[o] Tock.
18/05/11
Each was gambling, not with any vehicle of probability, which had been eliminated from the equation, but with each other's intentions. The Thief indeed took the Seer's bait, stealing the luck needed to affect the flip in defiance of her dare. And in turning to leave, she then posed a dare of her own to the Seer, challenging her to back up the implied threat.

This was the Thief's gamble. She wagered the Seer would not be able to go through with it.

[o] It turned out,
18/05/11
She was right.

[o] So ends a tale of rivalry.
18/05/11
Well, almost. There's a bit more.

But in order to understand its proper conclusion, we should first catch up with another of my other proteges, from whom I'm expecting a message shortly. 

The other Seer. 

The other Hero of Light.

She flew away to take vengeance on the Noir this side of The Scratch. That is, the one less angry and dangerous. The one not yet unmotivated by a compelling duel.

[o] Compelling, but not particularly challenging.
21/05/11
The Seer wouldn't win this duel. 

My apologies if this spoils the outcome for you. I can't speak as discreetly about such matters against this canvas.

I'll remind you that the pacing of my account will be characterized by a reduction in granularity from what you have come to expect by way of an undamaged disc. You will imagine the remainder of the duel to be sensational, and I will continue my steady distribution of facts as if they were pieces of candy, poured from a bottomless white hemisphere. 

The duel ends. The Seer dies. The Slayer departs. The Heir comes back to life.

[o] This outcome was hardly a point of suspense.
25/05/11
It would be disingenuous of me to present it as such, and I will not belittle your intelligence with such a tawdry narrative ploy. It would be rude, and I am too well dressed for that kind of behavior.

If there truly stood some chance of permanence to the Heir's corpsehood, I can hear you asking now...

[o] How could this moment later come to pass?
25/05/11
And for that matter, what sort of story would this be, with our human Hero of Breath made to stay a cadaver? Definitely not one the alpha timeline would allow.

[o] And what sort of spectator would you be...
25/05/11
If you'd forgotten the terms ruling the conditional immortality he won with his previous, similarly unceremonious impaling?

[o] He'd done nothing to earn martyrdom,
25/05/11
By which we might laud his fall as heroic.

Nor had he tasted notoriety,
To secure a death one may parse just.

[o] And while I can't give you my assurance,
26/05/11
I'm reasonably convinced of this much. When the Hero of Breath dies for good, it won't be as a scoundrel.

[o] But not for lack of a devoted mentor.
26/05/11
If I had served as his mentor directly, rather than as his mentor's mentor's mentor, he may have stood a fair chance of perpetrating something underhanded. At the very least, his jokes might have been better.
